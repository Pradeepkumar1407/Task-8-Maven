This project demonstrates the automation of a Java application build process using Jenkins (installed Locally)and Maven 
Then I build a simple Java "Hello World" application and use Apache Maven to manage the build lifecycle (compile, package, test, etc.). Then,I configured a Jenkins Freestyle job to automatically fetch the project from a Git repository, build it using Maven, and produce a .jar output.
Also Attached the screenshot of all Deleivarables for your reference and pushed the target folder with Jar file to Github repo.
